aiml
***********

This is a fork of the `PyAIML`_ Python AIML interpreter. It has been
refactored to make it install and work in both Python 2.7 and Python 3.

You can install it with `pip install aiml`.

PyAIML is (c) Cort Stratton. *aiml* uses the same license as PyAIML 
(2-clause BSD), except for the ALICE AIML files taken from the `Free ALICE AIML
set`_, which are licensed with the `LGPL`_ license.


Scripts
=======

Two small scripts are added upon installation:

* ``aiml-validate`` can be used to validate AIML files
* ``aiml-bot`` can be used to start a simple interactive session with a bot,
  after loading either AIML files or a saved brain file.


Datasets
========

The installation includes two AIML datasets:

* The *standard* AIML set, as it was included in PyAIML
* The `Free ALICE AIML set`_ v. 1.9, taken from the data published by the
  `ALICE AI Foundation`_ (with a few small fixes in files that did not 
  validate as `AIML 1.0.1`_)

They can be loaded via the ``bootstrap`` method in the ``Kernel`` class. See 
the `bot.py`_ script for an example.



Tests
=====

There are a number of unit tests included (in the ``test`` subdirectory); they 
can be executed by the setup infrastructure as::

  python setup.py test

or they can also be launched by directly calling::

  python test [testname ...]

This last version allows executing only some of the test files by explicitly
naming them in the command line; if none is specified all will be executed.

Original README from PyAIML
===========================


PyAIML is an interpreter for AIML (the Artificial Intelligence Markup
Language), implemented entirely in standard Python.  It strives for
simple, austere, 100% compliance with the AIML 1.0.1 standard, no less
and no more.

This is currently pre-alpha software.  Use at your own risk!

For information on what's new in this version, see the ``CHANGES.txt`` file.

For information on the state of development, including the current level of 
AIML 1.0.1 compliance, see the ``SUPPORTED_TAGS.txt`` file.

Quick & dirty example (assuming you've downloaded the "standard" AIML set)::

	import aiml

	# The Kernel object is the public interface to
	# the AIML interpreter.
	k = aiml.Kernel()

	# Use the 'learn' method to load the contents
	# of an AIML file into the Kernel.
	k.learn("std-startup.xml")

	# Use the 'respond' method to compute the response
	# to a user's input string.  respond() returns
	# the interpreter's response, which in this case
	# we ignore.
	k.respond("load aiml b")

	# Loop forever, reading user input from the command
	# line and printing responses.
	while True: print k.respond(raw_input("> "))
